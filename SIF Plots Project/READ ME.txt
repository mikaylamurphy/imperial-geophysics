---SIF Plots Distance Gradient.R----

TO RUN: test <- SIF_plot('~/Downloads/fracture_sif_data_raw.txt', '~/Downloads/surface_areas.txt') 
Replace the above paths with file paths of choice, SIF data path first and surface area path second.

The Distance Gradient graphs colour points based on their distance from the closest tip of a different fracture. Points that are closest to another fracture are coloured blue, with the farthest point being coloured red. The size of the points scales with surface area.

Five pages of graphs are produced, each with four plots (KI, KII, KIII, and G):
*Page 1: Surface Area vs. Raw SIF value, scaled automatically.
*Page 2: Surface Area vs. Raw SIF value, manually scaled so as to be comparable between data sets. The current axis limits are y-axis= 0e00 to 5e10, x-axis= 0 to 30. These limits can be changed in lines 92-96 if needed.
*Page 3: Mean Surface Area vs. Mean SIF value. The mean of all surface area and SIF values for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is calculated and plotted. Thus there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture. 
*Page 4: Surface Area vs. Min SIF value. The minimum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the min SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the min KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values area averaged. Again, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture.
*Page 5: Surface Area vs. Max SIF value. The maximum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the max SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the max KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values are averaged. Again, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture.

Note that the mean graphs are coloured black while the min/max graphs have colour. This is due to the methodology I've been using to construct the graphs, which is as follows. 

For the min and max graphs, I find the min/max SIF values for each tip in each fracture, and then pull the associated surface area and colour values from the original data set to plot them with. If the min/max SIF values occur in more than one line of data (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the min KI value of 0 appeared 3x), I average the surface area values and choose one colour at random to plot it with. Choosing a colour at random is not ideal, but I've found that mixing the colours doesn't end up working well.

For the mean graphs, I find and plot the mean of the SIF values. As these SIF values are means and thus don't appear in the original data set, they don't have an associated surface area or colour. As such, I plot them with the mean surface area of each tip and leave the colour as black.

----SIF Plots Surface Area Gradient.R---

TO RUN: test <- SIF_plot('~/Downloads/fracture_sif_data_raw.txt', '~/Downloads/surface_areas.txt') 
Replace the above paths with file paths of choice, SIF data path first and surface area path second.

The Surface Area Gradient graphs colour points based on their relative surface area-- blue is the smallest surface area in a fracture while red is the largest (note the scale is per fracture, so the largest surface area of each fracture is coloured red, not just the one fracture that is the largest). The size of the points also scales with surface area.

Five pages of graphs are produced, each with four plots (KI, KII, KIII, and G):
*Page 1: Surface Area vs. Raw SIF value, scaled automatically.
*Page 2: Surface Area vs. Raw SIF value, manually scaled so as to be comparable between data sets. The current axis limits are y-axis= 0e00 to 5e10, x-axis= 0 to 30. These limits can be changed in lines 92-96 if needed.

*Page 4: Surface Area vs. Min SIF value. The minimum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the min SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the min KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values area averaged. Again, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture.
*Page 5: Surface Area vs. Max SIF value. The maximum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the max SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the max KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values are averaged.

---SIF Plots Surface Area vs. K Values for Individual Fractures.R---

This script plots Surface Ara vs. SIF values per fracture, so each fracture's data is shown separately. In appropriate graphs, data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black.

Four sets of graphs are produced, each with four pages of plots (KI, KII, KIII, and G):
*Set 1: Surface Area vs. Raw SIF value, scaled automatically. Data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black.
*Set 2: Mean Surface Area vs. Mean SIF value. The mean of all surface area and SIF values for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is calculated and plotted. Thus there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture. 
*Set 3: Surface Area vs. Min SIF value. The minimum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the min SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the min KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values area averaged. Again, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture.
*Set 4: Surface Area vs. Max SIF value. The maximum SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is determined. Then, it is plotted with the corresponding surface area value from the original data set. If more than one surface area corresponds with the max SIF value (eg. if for Fracture 1 Tip 1, the max KI value of 0 appeared 3x), the surface area values are averaged. Again, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture.

---SIF Plots Accounting for Changing Numbers of Tips.R---

TO RUN: test <- SIF_plot('~/Downloads/fracture_sif_data_raw.txt') 
Replace the above path with SIF data file paths of choice.

This script plots Tip Number vs. SIF values. In appropriate graphs, data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black. Note this code does not remove outliers that have SIF values larger than 10x Young's Modulus (eg. 1e+11).

Six pages of graphs are produced, each with four plots (KI, KII, KIII, and G):
*Page 1: Tip Number vs. Raw SIF value, scaled automatically. Data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black.
*Page 2: Tip Number vs. Mean SIF value. The mean SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is calculated and plotted. Thus, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture. 
*Page 3: Tip Number vs. Min SIF value. The min SIF value for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is calculated and plotted. Thus, there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture. 
*Page 4: Tip Number vs. Max SIF value. The max SIF values for each tip in each fracture (across all timesteps) is calculated and plotted. Thus there is one point plotted for each tip in each fracture. 
*Page 5: Tip Number vs. Difference in SIF values from Step 0. The difference in SIF values is calculated from the first step for each data point and plotted. Data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black.
*Page 6: Tip Number vs. Difference in SIF values from Previous Step. The difference in SIF values is calculated from the previous step for each data point (except those from Step 0, as there is no previous step) and plotted. Data points from the first step are coloured blue and data points from the last step are coloured red, with all others being coloured black.

---SIF Plots Greyscale with coloured endpoitns.R---

This code is the same as SIF Plots Accounting for Changing Numbers of Tips.R , except that it only works with fractures that have have the same number of tips at each step. Eg. if at step 0 Fracture 0 has 16 tips and Fracture 1 has 20, it will only work if Fracture 0 has 16 tips and Fracture 1 has 20 tips at each ensuing step. See SIF Plots Accounting for Changing Numbers of Tips.R (above) for documentation.

Original code that plots Tip Number vs. SIF values. Each fracture is assigned a separate colour. In appropriate graphs, a colour gradient is used, with darkest colour representing step 0 and lightest colour representing the last step.
